h1. Dutch Stemmer

h2. Scala implementation of a Dutch stemming algorithm

Implementation of the stemming algorithm as documented at http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/dutch/stemmer.html
My aim was to make a stateless implementation which passes the tests to learn how the program Scala. The current version still has a couple of methods which probably could be refactored to be a little consiser; still working in that.

h2. Prerequisites

* sbt 1.9.x
* Scala 2.13.x

h2. Usage

call method DutchStemmer#stem with a string as argument and you get the stemmed version in return. See the tests in DutchStemmerTestSuite.scala.
Use `sbt test` to run the unit tests.
